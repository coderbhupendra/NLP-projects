# NLP-projects
Natural Language Processing related project done in IIT Madras.
Programming language used :Python and theano framework 
In this there are three projects:
1)language_translation_en : In this i made a rnn_encoder_decoder model to train the parallel corpus of English and German.
rnn_encoder_decoder.py this contain the Rnn_encoder_decoder neural model 
train.py we use above Rnn_encoder_decoder neural model  to train my language dataset i.e 

other files are used for making training and test dataset , shuffling them , checking is the dataset formed is correct or not and to see if model works correctly or not.

data_rnn_classify.py is used to make a training and test data set for wrong correct(w/c) approach 
lstm_model_check.py is used for checking the final result of prediction for w/c approach 

For both languages  ngram_model is made inorder to learn the Embedding Vector for words in dictionary , dictionary contain top 10,000 frequent words of corpus , for ngram_model i used a RNN neural network to  predict the n+1 th word given n previous words.And these embedding vectors will be used by rnn_encoder_decoder model. 

2)Similarly language_translation_de does the samething for German dataset.
3)language_translation is used to translate a English sentence to German , using above models only.
